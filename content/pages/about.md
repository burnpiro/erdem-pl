I'm a software engineer and consultant specializing in Javascript applications. When did I start? Long time ago... 2001 maybe. But back then, there wasn't really anything even remotely similar with current technology. I didn't start writing code directly in JS, my first language was Pascal and then C/C++. The Web started a couple of years later, around 2005/2006. I finished my master's degree in CS (Data Science) in 2021, and since then, I'm dealing mostly with Machine Learning (Generative Models) and high-performance web application.

But, what do I do exactly? Mostly everything related to Machine Learning and JavaScript:

- ML (Pytorch, TensorFlow and TensorflowJS)
- FrontEnd (a list is really long, but the main technology is React)
- NodeJS (Koa, Hapi, Express)
- Medical Imaging (DICOM)
- Mobile (React Native)
- JS Engines (V8, Chakra)
- Testing (Jest, Jasmine, Puppeteer, Cypress and many more)
- DevOps (build systems, process management and load balancing with PM2 or Cluster, CI/CD)

That's a really long list, I'm surprised you're read it all. If you want to grab a coffee, I'm currently stationed in Wroclaw (Poland).

### Hi! I'm Kemal

I'm a software engineer and consultant specializing in Javascript applications. When did I start? Long time ago... 2001 maybe. But back then there wasn't really anything even remotely similar with current technology. I didn't start writing code directly in JS, my first language was Pascal and then C/C++. Web started couple years later, around 2005/2006. Currently, I'm dealing mostly with Machine Learning and Tensorflow.

But, what do I do exactly? Mostly everything related with Machine Learning and JavaScript:
- ML (TensorFlow and TensorflowJS)
- FrontEnd (list is really long but main technology is React)
- NodeJS (Koa, Hapi, Express)
- IoT (JohnnyFive, CyclonJS, duino, NodeRED)
- Mobile (React Native)
- JS Engines (V8, Chakra)
- Testing (Jest, Jasmine, Puppeteer, Cypress and many more)
- DevOps (build systems with Webpack/Rollup, process management and load balancing with PM2 or Cluster, CI/CD)

That's really long list, I'm surprised you're read it all. If you want to grab a coffee I'm currently stationed in Wroclaw (Poland).
